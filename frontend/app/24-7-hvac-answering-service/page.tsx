      question: 'How does 24/7 AI answering service work for HVAC companies?',
      answer: 'Kestrel AI answers your business phone 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including holidays. When a customer calls at 2 AM with no heat, the AI immediately answers, assesses the emergency, and either books an appointment or routes to your on-call technician based on your protocols. No human intervention required.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens to after-hours emergency calls?',
      answer: 'Emergency calls are automatically triaged based on your custom protocols. For example, "no heat" in winter with temperatures below 32°F triggers immediate dispatch to your emergency line. Less urgent issues are booked for next-day service. You define the rules; Kestrel executes them perfectly every time.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can the AI wake up my on-call technician for emergencies?',
      answer: 'Yes. For true emergencies, Kestrel can transfer the call directly to your on-call tech, send an SMS with call details, or both. The technician receives a full transcript and recording before they even answer, so they know exactly what they\'re walking into.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does 24/7 coverage cost compared to hiring staff?',
      answer: 'Hiring 24/7 human receptionists costs $60,000-$90,000/year plus benefits <sup>[4]</sup>. Kestrel AI provides the same coverage for $17,964-$29,964/year depending on your plan, with zero sick days, vacations, or turnover. Most clients see ROI within 60 days.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What if I already have an answering service for after-hours?',
      answer: 'Most HVAC companies find that traditional answering services miss 15-20% of calls due to high call volume, have slow response times (30+ seconds), and can\'t book appointments in real-time. Kestrel answers in 200ms, never misses a call, and books directly into ServiceTitan while the customer is on the phone.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Does it work on holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving?',
      answer: 'Yes. Kestrel AI works every single day of the year, including Christmas, Thanksgiving, New Year\'s, and all other holidays. No premium rates, no coverage gaps. Your customers get the same instant response on Christmas morning as they do on a Tuesday afternoon.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I customize after-hours vs. business hours behavior?',
      answer: 'Absolutely. You can set different protocols for business hours (transfer to office), after-hours (book appointments or route emergencies), and weekends. Many clients use Kestrel as overflow during the day and primary answering after 5 PM.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What\'s the average revenue from after-hours calls?',
      answer: 'Industry data shows emergency HVAC calls average $850 in revenue (vs. $385 for scheduled maintenance). A company receiving just 10 emergency calls/month generates $102,000/year in after-hours revenue. Missing even 20% of those calls costs $20,400/year.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How quickly can I get 24/7 coverage set up?',
      answer: 'Most HVAC companies are live with 24/7 coverage within 48 hours. Our onboarding includes: configuring your emergency protocols, setting up after-hours routing, integrating with ServiceTitan/Jobber, and testing with real call scenarios.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What if the AI can\'t handle a complex after-hours call?',
      answer: 'Kestrel AI handles 99.2% of HVAC calls without human intervention <sup>[5]</sup>. For the rare complex scenario, you can configure fallback routing to your on-call manager or emergency line. Every call is recorded and transcribed, so you have full context.'

              <strong>Industry research shows</strong> that 87% of after-hours calls to HVAC companies go unanswered <sup className="text-sm">[1]</sup>. When a homeowner's
