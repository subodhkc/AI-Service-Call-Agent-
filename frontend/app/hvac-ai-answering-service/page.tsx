      question: 'How does an AI answering service differ from a traditional answering service?',
      answer: 'Unlike traditional services that rely on human operators, Kestrel AI responds in 200ms, never takes breaks, and handles unlimited calls simultaneously. It integrates directly with your ServiceTitan or Jobber account, automatically books appointments, and routes emergencies based on your custom protocols.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can the AI handle emergency HVAC calls?',
      answer: 'Absolutely. Kestrel AI is specifically trained on HVAC emergency protocols. It can identify urgent situations (no heat in winter, gas leaks, AC failures in extreme heat), triage based on severity, and immediately dispatch to your on-call technician or emergency line.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if the AI doesn\'t understand a caller?',
      answer: 'Kestrel AI uses advanced natural language processing with 99.2% accuracy for HVAC-specific terminology. In rare cases where clarification is needed, it asks follow-up questions. You can also configure fallback routing to a human operator for complex scenarios.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does it take to set up?',
      answer: 'Most HVAC companies are live within 48 hours. Our white-glove onboarding includes: importing your service areas, configuring emergency protocols, integrating with ServiceTitan/Jobber, training the AI on your pricing, and testing with real call scenarios.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Does it integrate with ServiceTitan?',
      answer: 'Yes. Kestrel AI has native ServiceTitan integration. It automatically looks up existing customers, creates new customer records, books appointments in available time slots, and logs all call details with recordings and transcripts.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What\'s the ROI compared to hiring a 24/7 receptionist?',
      answer: 'A 24/7 human receptionist costs $60,000-$90,000/year plus benefits. Kestrel AI costs $17,964/year (at our Growth plan) and handles unlimited calls with zero sick days. Most clients see ROI within 60 days from recovered missed calls alone.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I customize what the AI says?',
      answer: 'Yes. You control greetings, hold messages, pricing quotes, service area responses, and emergency protocols. We provide templates based on top-performing HVAC companies, but everything is customizable to match your brand voice.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What if call volume exceeds my plan?',
      answer: 'We never cut off service. If you exceed your plan\'s call limit, we charge $2.50 per additional call. We\'ll also notify you and recommend upgrading to a higher tier if it makes financial sense.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is my customer data secure?',
      answer: 'Yes. Kestrel is SOC 2 Type II certified, HIPAA compliant, and uses bank-level encryption. All call recordings and customer data are stored in secure US-based data centers with 99.9% uptime SLA.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I try it before committing?',
      answer: 'Yes. We offer a 14-day pilot program where we run Kestrel AI alongside your existing answering solution. You can compare call quality, booking rates, and customer satisfaction before making a decision.'

            <p className="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              An HVAC AI answering service is an autonomous voice agent that answers your business phone calls 24/7/365, 
              qualifies caller intent, books appointments, and routes emergencies—without human intervention. Unlike traditional 
              answering services that rely on offshore operators reading scripts, AI answering services use advanced natural 
              language processing to have natural conversations with your customers.
            </p>
            <p className="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              For HVAC companies, this means never missing an emergency call at 2 AM, instantly booking maintenance appointments 
              during peak season, and eliminating the $60,000+/year cost of 24/7 human receptionists. The AI understands HVAC-specific 
              terminology like "no heat," "refrigerant leak," and "zone control issues," and can make intelligent routing decisions 
              based on urgency, customer status, and technician availability.
            </p>
            <p className="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
              Modern AI answering services integrate directly with field service management platforms like ServiceTitan, Jobber, 
              and FieldEdge, automatically creating customer records, booking appointments in available time slots, and logging 
              detailed call notes with recordings and transcripts.

              <p className="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Kestrel responds to callers in under 200 milliseconds—10x faster than competitors. This isn't just about speed; 
                it's about creating a natural conversation flow that feels human. Customers don't realize they're talking to AI 
                until we tell them.
              </p>
              <p className="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
                Our proprietary voice engine eliminates the awkward pauses and robotic responses that plague other AI phone systems. 
                The result: 94% of callers rate the experience as "excellent" or "good."

              <p className="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Real conversations aren't linear. Customers interrupt, change topics, and ask clarifying questions. Kestrel handles 
                these natural speech patterns seamlessly, unlike rigid IVR systems that force callers through menu trees.
              </p>
              <p className="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
                If a customer says "Wait, actually I need emergency service," mid-conversation, Kestrel immediately pivots to 
                emergency protocols without missing a beat.

              <p className="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Kestrel is trained on HVAC emergency scenarios: no heat in winter, gas leaks, electrical issues, AC failures 
                during heat waves. It asks diagnostic questions to assess severity, then routes based on your custom protocols.
              </p>
              <p className="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
                Example: "No heat" in January with outdoor temps below 32°F triggers immediate dispatch to your emergency line. 
                "No AC" in April might book next-day service. You define the rules; Kestrel executes them perfectly every time.

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-neutral-900 mb-4">ServiceTitan Integration</h3>
              <p className="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Native integration with ServiceTitan means Kestrel automatically looks up existing customers by phone number, 
                retrieves service history, and books appointments in available time slots—all while the customer is on the phone.
              </p>
              <p className="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
                Every call is logged with full transcripts, recordings, sentiment analysis, and AI-generated summaries. Your 
                dispatchers see exactly what was discussed before they even pick up the phone.

                During a February cold snap, a Dallas HVAC company handled 127 emergency "no heat" calls between 6 PM and 6 AM.
