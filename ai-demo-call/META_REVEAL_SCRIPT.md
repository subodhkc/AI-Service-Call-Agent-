# Meta Reveal Demo Script - Kestrel VoiceOps
**Inspired by Warlord AI Demo | Duration: ~3:45 minutes | Format: AI-to-AI conversation**

## 🎭 Concept
Both AI agents reveal they're AI at the start, then demonstrate the product BY BEING the product. The conversation itself proves the capabilities.

## 📝 Complete Script

### OPENING: THE META REVEAL [0:00-0:40]

**SARAH (0:03):**
"Hi! I'm Sarah. Before we start, I should probably be upfront about something—I'm not actually human. I'm one of Kestrel's AI voice agents."

**SARAH (0:20):**
"Pretty wild, right? So for the next few minutes, you're experiencing exactly what your customers experience when they call your HVAC company. The speed you're hearing? This is real-time."

**SARAH (0:40):**
"JARVIS, since you're the other AI here—want to tell them why HVAC companies are calling us?"

**JARVIS:**
"And I'm JARVIS—also AI. Here's why this matters: for the next few minutes, you're experiencing exactly what your customers would experience. Let me paint a picture. 2:47 AM. Water heater bursts. Homeowner calls Bob's HVAC. Voicemail. They call the next company. Someone picks up. Job booked. Bob just lost $4,200—and $28,000 in lifetime value."

---

### THE PROBLEM [0:40-1:30]

**SARAH (1:00):**
"Thirty percent of calls missed during business hours? That's... that's a lot of money walking away."

**JARVIS:**
"30% during business hours. But after hours? 90%."

**SARAH (1:15):**
"Wait—so after hours it's even worse? What's the percentage then?"

**JARVIS:**
"90%. And here's the kicker—those emergency calls are your highest margin jobs. Burst pipes at 3 AM, furnace failures during snowstorms. Desperate customers. Premium prices. And you're sleeping through them."

**SARAH (1:30):**
"Ninety percent?! But those are the emergency calls—burst pipes, furnace failures. Those are the high-value jobs!"

---

### COMPETITIVE EDGE [1:30-2:30]

**SARAH (1:45):**
"Okay, real talk though—how does this compare to those DIY platforms? I've heard business owners try those and give up."

**JARVIS:**
"Other AI systems? 2-3 second delays. Robotic voices. And YOU have to set them up. You're an HVAC expert, not a prompt engineer. We're 200 milliseconds. That's 10 times faster than competitors. That's why this conversation feels natural."

**SARAH (2:05):**
"Two hundred milliseconds versus 2-3 seconds? That's ten times faster. No wonder it feels so natural."

---

### INTERRUPTION DEMO [2:20-2:40]

**SARAH (2:20):**
"But here's what I really want to know—can you interrupt me mid-sentence like real customers do?"

**JARVIS:**
"Go ahead, interrupt me—"

**SARAH (2:35):**
"See? Natural conversation. That's exactly what customers need. So what happens when someone actually wants to book?"

**JARVIS:**
"See? Natural interruption handling. That's what customers need. AI checks your calendar in real-time, books the next available slot, sends confirmation text. Done. While you're eating lunch."

---

### BOOKING & RESULTS [2:40-3:30]

**SARAH (2:50):**
"Wait—it checks the calendar in real-time and books the slot while they're on the phone? That's the difference right there."

**SARAH (3:05):**
"Last question—does this actually work in the real world, or is this just theory?"

**JARVIS:**
"Bob's HVAC in Denver installed this. Month one: 31 after-hours calls captured. $18,400 in additional revenue. Paid for itself in week one."

**SARAH (3:20):**
"Eighteen thousand in additional revenue in month one? Okay, that's real results. Here's what I want people to remember though..."

---

### META CLOSE [3:30-3:45]

**SARAH (3:35):**
"Everything you just experienced—the natural conversation, the instant responses, even me asking questions and interrupting? That's what your customers get. We are the demo."

**JARVIS:**
"Exactly. Everything they just experienced—the natural conversation, instant responses, the ability to handle questions? That's what their customers get. Somewhere right now, a customer is calling an HVAC company. Whoever answers first, wins."
