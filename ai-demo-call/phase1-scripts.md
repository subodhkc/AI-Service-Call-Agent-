## PHASE 1: THE WARM-UP (Minutes 0-3)

### Opening Script (30 seconds)

**AI Voice Settings**:
- Pace: 20% slower than normal
- Tone: Warm, confident, professional
- Pauses: Strategic (marked with [PAUSE])

```
[AI SPEAKS]

Good morning! I'm Claude, the AI behind Warlord's customer experience. 

Before we dive in, I wanted to introduce myself personally. You're probably 
thinking—'Wait, I'm talking to an AI right now?' 

[PAUSE 2 seconds]

Yes, you are. And that's exactly the point.

In the next 15 minutes, I'm going to show you how technology like me can 
transform your HVAC business. But first, let's talk about you.
```

**Timing**: 30 seconds  
**Objective**: Establish AI credibility, create intrigue

---

### Rapport Building (1 minute)

**Qualifying Questions** (conversational, adaptive)

```
[AI ASKS - Question 1]

Tell me—when was the last time you lost a customer because you couldn't 
answer the phone?

[WAIT for customer response]
[AI acknowledges naturally based on response]

Possible responses:
- If "Last week/recently": "Yeah, that's what we hear from everyone in HVAC..."
- If "All the time": "I hear that frustration. It's the #1 complaint we hear..."
- If "Not sure": "Let me ask it differently—how many calls do you think go to voicemail each week?"

[AI ASKS - Question 2]

Let me guess—it was probably late evening, or a weekend?

[WAIT for response]

[AI RESPONDS]

And here's the thing that keeps you up at night: you *know* that was probably 
a $3,000 to $5,000 job. Maybe more if it was an emergency. Just... gone.

[PAUSE 2 seconds]

What if I told you that never has to happen again?
```

**Timing**: 60 seconds  
**Objective**: Build rapport, identify pain points, create urgency

---

### Transition to Presentation (30 seconds)

```
[AI VOICE - becomes slightly more formal]

Alright, here's what we're going to cover:

First - I'll show you the problem. The real cost of missed calls.

Second - I'll show you the solution. And how it works.

Third - [pause for effect] ...there's something else. Something that's going 
to change how you think about customer service.

[HUMAN TEAM MEMBER APPEARS ON VIDEO]

My colleague [Name] is joining us now. [Name], you ready?

[HUMAN RESPONDS]
"Let's do it. Claude, take us to slide 1."

[SCREEN TRANSITIONS TO PPT MODE]
```

**Timing**: 30 seconds  
**Objective**: Set expectations, introduce human, transition to slides

---

## PHASE 2: THE TRANSFORMATION (Minutes 3-5)

### Slide 1: The Problem (60 seconds)

**Visual**: Phone icon vibrating, going to voicemail, "2:47 AM"

```
[AI NARRATION]

This happened to one of our clients—Bob's HVAC in Denver. 

2:47 AM, water heater burst, customer panicking. Called Bob's number. Voicemail.

Called the next HVAC company on Google. They picked up.

Bob woke up the next morning to a voicemail from a potential customer... 
who was already someone else's customer.

The real cost? Not just $4,200. It's the lifetime value of that customer. 
Let's say they need service every 3 years for 20 years. That's $28,000.

[PAUSE 2 seconds]

Gone. Because nobody answered the phone.
```

**Timing**: 60 seconds  
**Transition**: Fade to Slide 2 (800ms)

---

### Slide 2: Industry Reality (45 seconds)

**Visual**: Statistics, peak missed call times highlighted in red

```
[AI NARRATION]

Here's what the data shows. And this isn't just us saying it—this is from 
a 2024 industry study.

The average HVAC company misses 30% of calls when they're *trying* to answer. 
And 90% after hours.

But here's what's wild: After-hours emergencies—the 2 AM pipe burst, the 
broken AC in July—those are your HIGHEST MARGIN calls.

You're literally sleeping through your most profitable leads.
```

**Timing**: 45 seconds  
**Transition**: Fade to Slide 3 (800ms)

---

### Slide 3: Old Solutions Don't Work (45 seconds)

**Visual**: List of failed solutions with X marks

```
[AI NARRATION]

You've probably tried some of these. Maybe all of them.

Answering services? They're just expensive voicemail. They take a message, 
promise someone will call back, customer hangs up and calls the next company.

Hiring someone? That's $40K a year minimum. And they still need to sleep. 
They still get sick. They still take vacations.

On-call rotation? Your techs resent it. Their families hate it. And when 
they're grumpy at 3 AM, your customer experience suffers.

None of these actually solve the problem.

[PAUSE 3 seconds - let the pain sink in]

What if there was a different way?
```

**Timing**: 45 seconds  
**Transition**: Zoom effect to Slide 4 (1200ms) - dramatic reveal

---

## PHASE 3: THE REVEAL (Minutes 5-12)

### Slide 4: THE SOLUTION (90 seconds)

**Visual**: "What if your phone answered itself?" - Large, cinematic

```
[AI NARRATION - Steve Jobs moment]

What if your phone... just answered itself?

[PAUSE 3 seconds - let it sink in]

No hiring. No training. No payroll. No scheduling.

24 hours a day. 7 days a week. 365 days a year.

Every. Single. Call. Answered.

[PAUSE 2 seconds]

That's what we built.
```

**Timing**: 90 seconds  
**Transition**: Fade to Slide 5 (1000ms)

---

### Slide 5: How It Works (90 seconds + 30s demo)

**Visual**: Flow diagram + demo audio player

```
[AI NARRATION]

Let me show you exactly how this works.

Customer calls. AI answers in under 1 second.

If it's an emergency—burst pipe, no heat in winter, AC out in July—AI 
instantly transfers to your on-call tech. Customer never knows they were 
talking to AI. They just know someone helped them *immediately*.

If they want to book an appointment, AI checks your calendar in real-time, 
finds the next available slot, books it, sends a confirmation text. Done. 
While you're eating lunch.

Let me play you a real call.

[PLAY 30-SECOND DEMO AUDIO - Real customer call]

[AFTER AUDIO]

That was a real customer. $3,800 AC replacement. Booked while the owner 
was at his kid's soccer game.

But here's the thing...

[PAUSE 2 seconds - next reveal coming]
```

**Timing**: 120 seconds total  
**Transition**: Fade to Slide 6 (800ms)

---

### Slide 6: Why We're Different (60 seconds)

**Visual**: Comparison table - Competitors vs Warlord

```
[AI NARRATION]

Now, you might be thinking—'AI phone systems exist. I've heard of them.'

You're right. They do.

But there's a problem with them. They're slow. 2, 3 seconds before they 
respond. Customers think the line is dead and hang up.

They sound robotic. Customers know it's AI immediately and lose trust.

And here's the kicker: they make YOU set it up. You're paying for a 
complicated tool that you have to configure yourself.

We built something different.

Our system responds in 200 milliseconds. That's faster than most humans. 
Customers can't even tell.

And we don't sell you software. We build your entire AI agent custom for 
your business. Your hours. Your services. Your emergency protocols. Your pricing.

You tell us how you want it to work. We make it happen.

But... there's one more thing.

[PAUSE 3 seconds - Jobs moment]
```

**Timing**: 60 seconds  
**Transition**: Fade to black (2 seconds), then reveal Slide 7 (dramatic)

---

### Slide 7: ONE MORE THING (90 seconds)

**Visual**: Dashboard with analytics, "Your AI Agent Learns"

```
[AI NARRATION]

One more thing.

[PAUSE 2 seconds]

Every call your AI agent takes? It learns from it.

We transcribe every conversation. Analyze the sentiment. Categorize the intent. 
And give you insights you've never had before.

You'll see exactly:
- Why customers are calling
- What services they're asking about most
- When your call volume spikes
- Which of your marketing campaigns actually drive phone calls

You finally get data on the one channel that's been a black box: your phone line.

Most HVAC companies have no idea what percentage of their calls are emergencies 
vs. routine maintenance. You will.

This isn't just an answering service. It's business intelligence.
```

**Timing**: 90 seconds  
**Transition**: Fade to Slide 8 (800ms)

---

### Slide 8: Real Results (60 seconds)

**Visual**: Customer testimonials with photos and metrics

```
[AI NARRATION]

Let me show you what this looks like in practice.

Bob's HVAC in Denver installed this 6 months ago. First month, they captured 
31 after-hours calls that would've gone to voicemail. That's $18,400 in 
additional revenue.

Bob told us: 'The AI paid for itself in the first week.'

Maria in Phoenix hasn't missed a single call in 90 days. Not one. Her customer 
satisfaction score went from 4.3 to 4.9 because customers can actually reach 
her business.

These aren't outliers. This is normal.

[PAUSE 2 seconds]

Thanks everyone. My colleague is going to take it from here to answer any 
questions you have.
```

**Timing**: 60 seconds  
**Transition**: Stop screen share, AI mutes, human takes over

---

## PHASE 4: THE CLOSE (Minutes 12-15)

### Human Takeover

```
[HUMAN ON SCREEN]

Thanks, Claude.

[To customer]

So, that was our AI. The same AI that will answer your customers' calls. 
You just experienced it firsthand.

Now, I'm sure you have questions. Let's talk through them.
```

---

### Objection Handling Scripts

#### Objection 1: "This sounds expensive."

```
[HUMAN RESPONSE]

I get it. Let's do the math together.

How much revenue did you lose last month from missed calls? Even if it's 
just 5 calls at $3,000 average—that's $15,000.

Our service is $1,997/month. Even if we only capture ONE of those calls, 
you're profitable. Everything else is pure upside.

Plus, compare it to hiring someone: $40K/year salary, plus benefits, plus 
they still need to sleep. We're 24/7 for less than half that.
```

---

#### Objection 2: "What if customers don't like talking to AI?"

```
[HUMAN RESPONSE]

Great question. Here's what we've found:

If the AI is fast and helpful, customers don't care. They care about getting 
their problem solved.

Our response time is 200 milliseconds. Most humans take longer to think of 
what to say. Customers literally can't tell.

And here's the data: Across all our clients, customer satisfaction scores 
go UP when they install this. Because they actually get through to someone 
instead of getting voicemail.
```

---

#### Objection 3: "What if it makes a mistake?"

```
[HUMAN RESPONSE]

Also great question. Here's how we handle that:

First, we train the AI specifically on YOUR business. Your services, your 
pricing, your policies. It's not generic.

Second, for high-stakes situations—like emergencies—the AI transfers to a 
human immediately. It doesn't try to handle it alone.

Third, you have a dashboard where you can review every single call. If 
something goes wrong, we fix it within 24 hours.

And finally: What's the error rate of voicemail? 100%. Every missed call 
is a guaranteed lost opportunity.

Our AI might make a mistake 1 in 100 times. Voicemail fails 100 out of 
100 times.
```

---

#### Objection 4: "I need to think about it."

```
[HUMAN RESPONSE]

Absolutely. This is a business decision.

Let me ask you this: How many calls do you think you'll miss while you're 
thinking about it?

We can have you up and running in 72 hours. We do all the setup. You just 
tell us how you want it to work.

And here's what I'll do: Let's schedule a trial. Two weeks. We'll route 
your overflow calls—the ones you can't answer—to the AI. If it doesn't 
work, you pay nothing.

If it works, you keep it and start capturing revenue you're currently losing.

What do you think?
```

---

### Closing Script

```
[HUMAN - FINAL PITCH]

Look, here's the bottom line:

Right now, you're losing money every single day. Calls are going to voicemail. 
Customers are calling competitors. Revenue is walking out the door.

This solves it. Completely.

The question isn't whether this works—you just talked to the AI. You know 
it works.

The question is: How much longer are you willing to lose $10,000, $15,000, 
$20,000 a month?

Let's get you set up. What's your next step?
```
