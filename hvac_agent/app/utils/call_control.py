"""
Call Control Module for HVAC Voice Agent.

Implements stronger input shaping for production call-center operation:
- Guided/binary prompts instead of open-ended questions
- Polite interruption logic for long speech
- One-variable-per-turn enforcement
- Call flow state machine

This should feel like a real dispatcher, not an IVR.
